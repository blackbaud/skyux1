The error directive provides a template that allows other components to display error messages when errors occur. The parent `bb-error` directive can contain multiple directives, and each one is optional.

### Error settings
  - `bb-error` &mdash; Wraps the error message in a SKY UX-themed container.
    - `bb-error-image` &mdash; Specifies an image to display in the error message.
    - `bb-error-title` &mdash; Specifies a title to display in the error message.
    - `bb-error-description` &mdash; Specifies a description to provide additional details in the error message.
    - `bb-error-action` &mdash; Specifies an action to include in the error message. For example, you can include a button to reload the page or to refresh data.
    - `bb-error-type` &mdash; Attribute to specify a set of pre-defined `bb-error-image`, `bb-error-title`, and `bb-error-description` directives. The user can provide `bb-error-image`, `bb-error-title`, and `bb-error-description` directives to override any of the pre-defined types. It can have the following values, and each of these values can also be applied as an error-type for `bb-error-image`, `bb-error-title`, and `bb-error-description` individually:
      - `broken` &mdash; An error indicating that some functionality on the page is broken.
      - `construction` &mdash; An error indicating that some functionality on the page is under construction.
      - `notFound` &mdash; An error indicating that a page was not found.

In addition to the directive, the error component includes a service that can display simple error messages in a modal window.

### Error modal settings

 - `bbErrorModal` &mdash; The service to inject in order to display an error message in a modal window.
   - `show(options)` &mdash; The function to call to display the error modal.  The `options` parameter supports the following properties:
     - `errorTitle` &mdash; Specifies a title to display in the error message.
     - `errorDescription` &mdash; Specifies a description to provide additional details in the error message.
