summary: The modal component launches modals in a way that is consistent with SKY UX applications.
---

The modal directive and service allow you to launch modals in a consistent way in SKY UX applications. Instead of the UI Bootstrap `$uibModal.open`, use `bbModal.open`. This takes the same options object but allows for some custom default behaviors in SKY UX.

In addition to the `bbModal` service to lauch modals, a `bb-modal` directive can provide a common look-and-feel for modal content. Within `bb-modal`, `bb-modal-header` displays a common modal header, `bb-modal-footer` displays a common modal footer and buttons, and `bb-modal-body` wraps the modal's body content.
