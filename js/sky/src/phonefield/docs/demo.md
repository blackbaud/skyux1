The phone number component wraps up the [intl-tel-input jQuery plugin](http://jackocnr.com/intl-tel-input.html) to enhance an input with aids in national and international phone number formatting and validation. You must use this directive in conjunction with the ngModel directive where the property bound to ngModel is the phone number value on your model.

### Dependencies ###
- **[intl-tel-input](http://jackocnr.com/intl-tel-input.html) (8.5.2 or higher)** Enhances a textbox with country-specific phone number formatting aids in national and international phone number formatting and validation. This includes a country dropdown that specifies the desired format and dial code of the input's phone number. Alternatively, if a dial code is provided in the input's phone number, the country dropdown will detect that dial code and select the dial code's country.
