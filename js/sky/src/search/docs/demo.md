The search component creates a mobile-responsive input control for users to enter search criteria.

### Search settings ###
- `bb-search-input` &mdash; Creates an input control for users to enter search criteria. On mobile devices, the component displays a search button that users can click to display the input control.
  - `bb-on-search` &mdash; Specifies a function to be called when users execute searches. The callback should have the following arguments:
    - `searchText` &mdash; Search text that has been applied.
  - `bb-on-search-text-changed` &mdash; *(Optional.)* Specifies a function to be called when search text in the input changes. The callback should have the following arguments:
    - `searchText` &mdash; New search text in the search input.
  - `bb-search-text` &mdash; *(Optional.)* Specifies search text that users can supply to the seach component.
  - `bb-search-placeholder` &mdash; *(Optional.)* Specifies placeholder text to display in the search input. If you include this attribute but do not specify a value, then the search input displays the default placeholder text "Find in this list."
- `bb-search-container` &mdash; Makes the `bb-search-input` component responsive on small screens. You include this directive as an attribute with no value on the container for the `bb-search-input` component.

### Search events ###
- `bbSearchInputApply` &mdash; When the search input control receives this event, it applies search text as if a user clicked the search button. If the event includes the optional `searchText` as an argument, then the text in the input is updated. If the event does not include `searchText`, then the existing text in the input is applied.
