The key info directive highlights important information. It can display any type of content but generally highlights details such as important summary numbers. The directive displays its main value in large, bold text, and it displays a corresponding label in smaller, plain text. By default, the directive uses a vertical layout with the label under the primary value, but you can also use a horizontal layout with the label to the side of the primary value.
